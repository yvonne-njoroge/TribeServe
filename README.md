## TribeServe — Smart Community Planner & Volunteer Hub

TribeServe is a full-stack MERN web application designed to empower physical and online communities to organize events, manage volunteers, assign tasks, and measure their collective impact.
It offers an all-in-one platform where organizers can create events, assign tasks, and track contributions, while volunteers can sign up, join activities, or make micro-contributions — even if they’re busy. With features like skill-based matching, real-time task boards, and gamified rewards, TribeServe makes community coordination efficient, inclusive, and fun.
